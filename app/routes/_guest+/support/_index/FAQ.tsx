		efficiency over time, ensuring you get the most reliable insights into 
		your financial health`,

		question: "Is my financial data stored securely?",
		answer: `Yes, your financial data is securely stored in the Google Drive account 
		linked to the email address you used when creating your account. We organize 
		your records in a dedicated folder named "ThinkLedger" to ensure both easy 
		access and enhanced security.`,

		question: "How accurate is the AI in categorizing transactions?",

	},
	{
		question: "Do I still need an accountant if I use your software?",
		answer: `While our AI handles day-to-day bookkeeping and reporting,

		accountants use our platform to collaborate with clients more efficiently.`,
